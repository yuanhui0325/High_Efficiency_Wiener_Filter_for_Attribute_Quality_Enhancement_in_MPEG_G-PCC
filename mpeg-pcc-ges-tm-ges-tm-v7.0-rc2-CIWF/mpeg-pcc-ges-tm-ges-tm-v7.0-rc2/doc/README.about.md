General Information
===================

Reference software is being made available to provide a reference
implementation of a profile for geometry-based coding of solid dynamic
content for the G-PCC standard being developed by MPEG-3DGC (ISO/IEC SC29 WG7).

One of the main goals of the reference software is to provide a
basis upon which to conduct experiments in order to determine which coding
tools provide desired coding performance. It is not meant to be a
particularly efficient implementation of anything, and one may notice its
apparent unsuitability for a particular use. It should not be construed to
be a reflection of how complex a production-quality implementation of a
profile for geometry-based solid and dynamic content coding with a future
G-PCC standard would be.

This document aims to provide guidance on the usage of the reference
software. It is widely suspected to be incomplete and suggestions for
improvements are welcome. Such suggestions and general inquiries may be
sent to the general MPEG 3DGC email reflector at
<mpeg-3dgc@gti.ssr.upm.es> (registration required).

Releases notes
--------------

The GeS-TM (for **Ge**ometry-based **S**olid content **T**est **M**odel),
is being based on a subset of the G-PCC adoptions for coding dynamic solid
contents. The original implementation started from the experimental model
being studied in EE13.60, and is based on the `release-v20.0-rc1` of G-PCC
test model TMC13.

### `ges-tm-v7.0`

Tag `ges-tm-v7.0` will be released after reported issues are resolved,
if any.

### `ges-tm-v7.0-rc2`

Tag `ges-tm-v7.0-rc2` will be released after further optimization and
cleanups of RAHT encoder have been performed.

### `ges-tm-v7.0-rc1`

Tag `ges-tm-v7.0-rc1` includes adoptions made during the meeting #16 of the
WG7 held in Sapporo (July 2024), and some additional fixes and cleanups.

- `trisoup/tidy: refactor to use dedicated node structure`  
    This commit replaces the use of "big" PCCOctree3Node structure within
    trisoup by the use of two new node structures respectively dedicated to
    the encoder and to the decoder. These structures only contains necessary
    information. This is achieved through templatization.

    This commit also includes minor cleanups.

- `attr/tidy: build and encode dual motion field in raster scan order`  
    makes dual motion MV field being encoded in same order as for geometry

- `attr/tidy: avoid generating full depth MSOctree`  
    In case octree geometry is used, it is not necessary to build a full
    depth MSOctree. This commit limits the depth to reach only the
    min_pu_size in case trisoup is not used.

- `attr/tidy: replace PUTrees with MVField`  
    Occupancy tree must be known to properly use PUTrees, this is not
    convenient for reusing geometry motion field with attributes.

    This commits replaces the PUTrees, used for motion field
    representation, with a more versatile and ease to use MVField
    representation.

- `attr/tidy: clipping compensated point cloud to slab boundaries`  
    This commit should slightly improve the prediction for localized
    attributes and accelerate its use in inter RAHT by clipping the
    compensated point cloud to fit within the slab boundaries.

- `octree/tidy: refactor to use common raster scan`  
    In this commit, Octree is refactored to use a common raster scan
    framework with dual motion field which makes the code a bit cleaner.

- `attr: m68327 - allow using mcap without using dual motion`  
    In this commit, HLS and code structure is changed to allow using motion
    compensated attributes projection even if dual motion is not enabled.

    This commit also avoids unneeded sort for motion compensated
    attributes.

- `attr/tidy: do not copy current attributes for mcap`  
    Attributes from reconstructed point cloud do not need to be copied with
    geometry before performing motion compensated attributes projection.
    This commit simplifies the code accordingly.

- `attr: m68327 - always use mcap`  
    As agreed during the meeting, motion compensated attributes projection
    (mcap) will always be used to simplify the codec and keep best coding
    performances. This commit enforce always using mcap and removes HLS
    previously used to enable it.

- `attr/tidy: remove not needed attributes compensation`  
    Now that mcap is always used, it in not needed to compensate the
    attributes when building compensated point cloud for geometry.

- `raht/tidy: simplify decoder translate layer`  
    Since mcap is now always used, num points, positions and weights are
    now the same in the compensated frame and in current frame.

    Decoder is simplified accordingly.

- `raht: m68283 - cross component residual prediction`  
    This commit uses buffer to dynamically maintain correlation information
    between the RAHT luma and RAHT Cb/Cr residues in order to derive a
    prediction of the chroma components residues with a linear model of the
    luma residues.

- `raht: m68397 - improve average prediction`  
    This commit improves inter frame average prediction by also taking into
    account the grand parent mode to determine average prediction weights.

- `geom/trisoup: m68255 - local quality units`  
    This commit introduces local quality units for trisoup.

- `trisoup: m68285 - reduce OBUF memory usage`  
    This commit reduces the memory usage when coding the Trisoup vertex
    position bits using OBUF scheme.

    This is scheme 1 of m68285.

- `trisoup: m68350 - memory reduction over m68285`  
    This commit further reduces memory usage and also takes care of memory
    allocation to further improve runtimes.

- `raht/tidy: remove FixedPoint and VecAttr`  
    FixedPoint was hiding many conversion and shift operations.
    These operations were progressively made visible again. Now, this
    commit totally removes the use of FixedPoint type.

    VecAttr is also removed, as the dynamic allocation nature of the vector
    it uses is not really justified.

- `raht/tidy: uniformization of buffers definition`  
    Some local buffers in raht are still defined as double entry arrays.
    Since single entry array convention is currently used for the main
    buffers, this commit uses the same notations for intermediate buffers.

- `raht/tidy: simplify encoder translate layer`  
    This commit simplifies encoder side as previously made for the decoder,
    since motion compensated projection is now always used.

- `enc: restrict slab thickness`  
    This commit restricts the slab thickness to be a multiple of any
    trisoup node sizes. Other values may provide unexpected results.

- `raht/tidy: use attr_t instead of int`  
    This commit makes using vectors of attr_t (i.e. uint16_t) instead of int
    as input/output of raht.

### `ges-tm-v6.0`

Tag `ges-tm-v6.0` has been released after some cleanups and a few minor bug
fixes (outside of CTCs) have been integrated.

### `ges-tm-v6.0-rc2`

Tag `ges-tm-v6.0-rc2` includes a few bug fixes and a refactoring of the RAHT.

- `raht: fix issue #2 - wrong condition used to access a table`:  
    Encoder was crashing when using inter frame coding with encoder parameter
    --rahtLayerInterModeSelectionEnabled=0, because it was accessing a non
    allocated table element. The table is not supposed to be used.

    A condition enabling the use of the table was based on the wrong variable
    name. This commit fixes the condition.

- `raht: fix issue #4 - RDO could select intra layer mode on root node`:  
    Encoder could select intra layer mode on root node, leading to mismatch
    between encoder and decoder output in some situations.
    This commit fixes this issue by enforcing infinite RD cost for intra
    layer mode on first layer.

- `raht: major refactoring`:  
    This commit provides a major refactoring of the RAHT code:

    - The code is split between the encoder and decoder into two
      separate files:
      - move RAHT.cpp -> RAHTEncoder.cpp
      - add RAHTDecoder.cpp
    - Many optimization are introduced within the decoder
    - Some are reported into the encoder, but the work on the encoder will be
      continued after next meeting cycle

- `enc: fix issue #5 - do not use std::log2 for RDO`:  
    This commit removes dependencies on std::log2() for the encoder when
    performing Rate Distortion Optimizations (RDO). Instead, a fixed point
    approximation of log2 pcc::fpLog2 is introduced so that the results will
    not depend on the platform and its implementation dependent math library.

    This commit thus changes computations for RAHT RDO, as well as for motion
    search, and should solve issue #5.

- `misc: fix issue #3`:  
    Theres is a bug in gcc-8.1/8.2 (fixed in 8.3). This commit avoids the
    compiler complaining for no reason.

    before and after attributes coding with current design of GeS-TM.

- `opti: m66238 - preliminary optimizations of NN search`:  
    This commit optimizes the nearest neighbour search used for motion

    EE13.60 Test 1.

- `attr: m66238 - dual motion field for color`:  
    - add dual motion field for color
    - add encoder options and hls flags for dual motion
    - update cfg files for CTCs (active with TriSoup)

- `attr: m66238 - motion compensated attributes projection`:  
    - add motion compensated attributes projection from reference frame to
      reconstructed geometry, to replace inter-frame attributes predictor,

    This is adopted EE13.60 - Test6, providing rate distorsion optimization
    of inter mode selection for RAHT (also adds signaling of the selected
    mode).

- `raht: fix - use safer approximation of tree depth`:  
    Method used for estimating raht tree depth in m66238 does not
    look safe: the distance between the first an last point in morton
    order is not representative of the actual boundaries of the point
    cloud. Also the function roundLog2 does not look correct.

    This is fixed by only considering the last point in morton order.

- `raht: fix - intra behavior shall not be changed`:  
    Complexity reduction introduced by prediction_threshold1 should be kept

    provides a prediction of raht coefficient made by a weighted average
    between inter and intra predictions.

- `raht: fix - out of bound votesum in divisionPredictionVotesLUT`:  
    `votesum` could be 12, when `getNeighborsMode()` is called and the parent
    node has no neighbors.

    This is solved by also considering the mode of the parent node itself
    when computing the values for vote(Inter/Intra[Layer])Weight.

- `misc: add helper functions to FixedPoint`:  
    - Add `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` operators to `FixedPoint`.

      from its internal `int64_t` representation.

- `raht: m66152 - sample domain prediction`:  
    This is adopted EE13.60 - Test 2, after being merged with Test 5 and
    Test 6. It uses sample domain prediction within a raht layer to avoid
    computing a forward transform in decoding process.

- `raht/enc: m66308 - transform domain distorsion estimation`:  
    Compute distorsion estimation in transform domain to avoid an extra
    inverse transform.

- `raht: m66373 - fix prediction mode determination`:  
    This commit aligns the software with the text description of m62583
    which introduced inter RAHT in GeS-TM. It changes the prediction mode
    determination for RAHT.

    slightly better for 8 bits attributes.

- `attr/raht: m65387 - extend number of coding contexts`:  
    Increase the number of contexts for coding attributes. It has

    Parts of refPointCloud that were not compensated are now copied
    into compensatedPointCloud.
  
    refPointCloud can be removed from trisoup (not necessary anymore).

- `geom/refactor: motion - use PCCPointSet3 instead of vectors`:  
    Uses PCCPointSet3 instead of vectors of coordinates in motion related
    algorithm (search and compensation) to be able to more easily compensate
    with attributes.

- `geom/motion: m64918 - octree based motion search`:  
    Uses an octree based motion search and compensation to remove LPU windows
    and there constrains.
    It allows to use wider motion search and compensation without increasing
    complexity.

    Provides attitional code cleanups:  
    - Removal of unused variables,
    - Removal of code in trisoup:  
      The code had been duplicated in a previous loop iterating on the
      nodes of a slice, for centroid determination with face vertices,
      and the original loopbecame unnecessary.

### `ges-tm-v3.0`

Tag `ges-tm-v3.0` has been released on top of `ges-tm-v3.0-rc1` since no other

    Arguments/arguments-list can now be delimited by parenthesis to allow
    nested sequencial types.

- `trisoup: m63661 - inter skip mode`:  
    In non-moving parts of a dynamic point cloud, it has been observed that
    the geometry inter prediction based on (zero) motion compensation may
    not be optimal due to lack of invariance of the compensation process.
  
    A new inter coding mode based on colocated vertices and nodes has been
    introduced to mimic a kind of skip mode for point cloud coding.

- `trisoup/ctc: m63660 - align slice BB to zero`:  
    Aligning slice origin to (0, 0, 0) coordinates by default.

    This is extracted from monolitic commit made for m64005  in EE repository.
    It provides some refactoring to RAHT.

- `restore: divisionless RAHT prediction`:  
    Reverts normative change made during the refactoring of RAHT. Integer
    division was (re-)introduced for inter layer prediction, but had not been
    presented nor discussed with WG7 during the meeting.  
    The original behavior (with tabulated division approximation) has been
    restored.

- `restore: fixed point log2 estimation for RAHT RDOQ`:  
    Reverts non-normative change made during the refactoring of RAHT.
    Fixed point arithmetic for RAHT RDOQ was replaced by floating points
    operations, but had not been presented nor discussed with WG7 during the
    meeting.  
    The original behavior (with fixed point approximation) has been
    restored.

- `restore: original neighbours retrieval for intra RAHT`:  
    Reverts normative change made during the refactoring of RAHT.
    The refactoring of the neighbours retrieval for RAHT was modifying the

    Integration notes:  
    - Some modifications affecting all-intra behaviour have been removed,
      as they were not discussed in WG7. It includes the coding of a mode
      for choosing the enabling or not of the inter layer prediction.
    - The syntax element `mode_level` has been moved as an inter-prediction
      dependent syntax element, since it should not affect all-intra.

- `attr/raht: m64218 - inference of prediction modes`:  
    Provides the inference of the prediction modes at certains levels of the
    RAHT decomposition.  
  
    Integration notes:  
    - The syntax element `upper_mode_level` has been moved and made
      dependent on RAHT `enable_inter_prediction`, since the mode
      should be infered only when inter prediction is enabled.

- `attr/raht: m64112 - fix rootLevel value`:  
    This is a fix on the derivation of the rootLevel value within RAHT.
    The rootLevel should be obtained by rounding to the upper integer value
    the division by 3 of the number of RAHT decomposition layers, to get the
    number of dyadic decomposition levels. Because latest one might be
    incomplete.

- `attr/raht: m64118 - integer Haar` 
    Introduces lossless extension to RAHT.  
  
    Integration notes:  
    - Added support for inter-RAHT with m64005:  
      - A simple rounding of the motion compensated predictor has
        been added,
      - The refactoring from m64005 has been modified to re-introduce
        templated use of RAHT/Haar kernels,
      - Kernel support for already normalized weights has been added.
    - Added cfg file for octree-raht-inter with lossless attributes

### `ges-tm-v2.0`

Tag `ges-tm-v2.0` was released on top of `ges-tm-v2.0-rc3` since no other
issue had been reported.

### `ges-tm-v2.0-rc3`

Tag `ges-tm-v2.0-rc3`,
- fixes an out of bound memory access, causing an assertion to occure in debug
  mode. This was unsucessfuly fixed in `ges-tm-v2.0-rc2`.

### `ges-tm-v2.0-rc2`

Tag `ges-tm-v2.0-rc2`,
- fixes uninitialized memory access to an encoding parameters;

  encoder, which had been accidentaly removed during refactoring.

### `ges-tm-v2.0-rc1`

Tag `ges-tm-v2.0-rc1` includes a few adoptions made during the meeting in
Antalya (April 2023).

- `octree: m62531 - nodes processing in raster scan order`:  
    Use lexicographic order (a.k.a. raster scan order) in octree geometry
    nodes processing to get same node ordering as used in trisoup.

- `entropy: m62547 - probability bounds for dynamic OBUF coders`

- `raht/enc: m63002 - replace log2() with LUT in RDOQ`:  
    Current RDOQ code for RAHT uses the log2() function to estimate the
    rate.

    The proposal simplifies this by using a LUT with a maximum of 16
    entries.

- `trisoup/enc: m62527 - align slices to trisoup node size grid`

- `trisoup: m62526 - Optimal weighted centroid`

- `trisoup/enc: m62981 - centroid quantization offset`

Adoption of raster-scan ordered nodes processing for octree provides an
unified processing order between octree and trisoup elements.
Tag `ges-tm-v2.0-rc1` includes important refactoring changes on trisoup and
optimizations that were made possible by this unified raster scan ordering,
as well as some code cleanups and simplifications.

The input contribution **m63611: \[GPCC\] Report on new architecture for GeS TM 
v2.0-rc1 and related integrations**
is intended to provide more details on theses modifications.

    Centroid operations are moved to dedicated functions:
    1. determination of centroid and dominant axis
    2. determination of normal vector and bounds
    3. determination of residual/drift
    4. determination of inter predictor for residual/drift

- `trisoup/tidy: cleaning in loop on triangles`

    Vertex determination is performed in same loop as neighbours and edges
    determination thanks to raster-scan order.

- `trisoup: optimize vertex encoding/decoding`

- `trisoup: refactor vertex inter prediction determination`:  
    Vertex determination for inter prediction is performed in same loop
    as neighbours, edges and intra vertex determination thanks to raster-scan
    order.

    Obsolete determineTrisoupVertices() function is removed.

- `trisoup: refactor vertices encoding/decoding`:  
    Vertex encoding/decoding is performed in same loop as neighbours, edges
    intra and inter vertex determination thanks to raster-scan order.

    Obsolete functions encodeTrisoupVertices() and decodeTrisoupVertices()
    are removed.

- `trisoup/tidy: localize some buffers`:  
    Some buffer are localized inside of function rather than being passed
    as parameters, since they are not used outside anymore.

- `trisoup: refactor triangles rendering`:  
    Put rendering of triangles of a node in specific function.
    Apply it in the same loop as the other trisoup operations,
    to get a single raster scan ordered nodes traversal.

    Remove obsolete function decodeTrisoupCommon().

- `trisoup/tidy: localize some arrays`:  
    Some array are now only used locally for raster scan traversal.

- `trisoup: optimize rendering/ray tracing`:  
  - use int64 values to represent in 1D 3 dimensional coordinates to
    accelerate duplicate points removal.
  - use one optimized function for each ray tracing directions.
  - optimize/simplify ray tracing.

- `trisoup: optimize duplicates removal and buffer allocation`

- `trisoup/tidy: various cleanups and optimizations`


On trisoup, all the divisions at decoder have been removed and replaced
by fixed point inverse multiplications (normative).

- `trisoup: remove divisions`:  
    remove all divisions at decoder.


Additional cleanups, simplifications and code optimization have been made,
mainly on inter-frame motion search and on octree coding.

- `tidy: minor cleanups`

- `geometry: optimize LPU inter search window generation`:  
  - avoid using unnecessary unordered_map -> decoder twice faster.
  - use BB for points inside the loop.
  - offset the points to slice origin during the loop (avoid multiple passes).

- `geometry: reduce size of LPU inter search window`

- `octree/tidy: remove IDCM variables in node + moved planar container for QTBT up`:  
  !! this may impact the code in case there are duplicated point removing turned on.

- `octree/tidy: optimizations and cleanups`

- `trisoup/tidy: more reasonable fifo size with trisoup`


Other changes includes the disabling of non-cubic nodes that is currently not
supported properly, and a bug fix for and issue that could happen outside of
CTCs.

- `ctc: disable non-cubic nodes`

- `trisoup: fix - determination of centroid predictor`:  
    When inter prediction is not used for a node, the centroid predictor
    could be wrongly estimated.


Documentation files for `ges-tm-v2.0-rc1` are also updated.

- `doc: update documentation files`


### `ges-tm-v1.0`

Tag `ges-tm-v1.0` adds a few fixes.

- `hls/entropy: add backward compatibility flag for m62220`:  
  Applies a fix for backward compatibility issue made in TMC13 for
  entropy coding related contribution m62220.

- `fix: read access outside of an array`:  
  The encoder could read outside of an array.
  Even if the value was not used, it could cause issues when debugging.
  This is fixed by accessing the array only when necessary, and so,
  when the index is inside of the array.

- `raht: fix RDOQ overflows`:  
  In rare cases overflows could occur during computation of Rate/Distortion,
  if distortion was really huge (ex: DC coefficient).
  This is fixed by limiting the computation to small coefficients only.


Additional cleanups were also made, mainly removing unused tools previously
commented out.

- `QTBT is not yet supported, avoid using it`:  
  QTBT is not yet supported by inter frame coding. When inter frame is
  used the tool cannot be activated.
- `removing global motion`
- `removing predictive geometry`
- `removing angular`
- `removing bytewise coder`
- `removing planar`  
  Note: some planar things are kept for QTBT handling.
- `removing predlift`


And the documentation files for `ges-tm-v1.0-rc1` have been added.

- `doc: update documentation files`


### `ges-tm-v1.0-rc1`

Tag `ges-tm-v1.0-rc1` adds all the latest adoptions integrated in the
release 21.0 of TMC13 and related/applicable to dense geometry content,
RAHT attributes and entropy coding.

- `trisoup/m61577: non-cubic nodes`:  
  Add possibility to use non cubic nodes on boundaries of the slices in
  order to avoid reconstruction artefacts and discontinuities between
  neighbouring slices.
  Node cubic nodes are determined based on a bounding box provided for the
  trisoup volume within the slice.

  It can be enabled separately for lowest coordinates in the slice and
  highest ones.

  Encoder decision is also added to determine the bounding box parameters.

- `trisoup/m61561: provide max num reconstructed points to encoder`:  
  Add possibility to provide separately to the encoder a maximum number of
  points reconstructed using trisoup before having to downsample the
  reconstruction.

  This allows to better control the number of input points per slice such
  that better coherence is obtained in the overall reconstructed content.

- `geom/m61583: reduce dynamic OBUF memory footprint`:  
  Reduce the amount of memory being used by dynamic OBUF.

- `raht/m61151: increase buffer precision to remove rounding ops`:  
  The precision is increased in the memory buffer used in RAHT to reconstruct
  attributes at each layer. Now, values are directly stored with fixed
  point precision, avoiding rounding operations during the transform.

- `entropy/m62220: simpler bypass bit with arithmetic coder`:  
  Simplify the operations for arithmetic coding in case of bypassed bits.

- `trisoup/m61982: rasterization with unitary sampling`:  
  Optimization to replace ray tracing by rasterization when no subsampling
  has to be used (trisoup_sampling_value_minus1 is equal to zero), and when
  integer precision rendering shall be used (trisoup_fine_ray_tracing_flag
  is equal to zero).

- `trisoup/m61982: voxelization of vertices on edges`:  
  Replace previous voxelization of trisoup vertices, which was not aligned
  on the edges, by a voxelization aligned on the edges.

  This voxelisation is not needed anymore when no sub-sampling is used:
  the vertices' points are already included in the rendered triangles.

- `trisoup/m61982: use thickness and adaptive halo with rasterization`:  
  Improve trisoup rendering by using thickness and adaptive halo with
  rasterization.


This release includes some extra optimizations.

- `ctc: consider level limit of 5 million points`:  
  For better efficiency, the GeS-TM currently considers hypothetical profile
  level limit of 5 million points per slice so that every frame is coded in
  an single slice.

- `trisoup: optimization of ray tracing`:  
  The ray tracing is performed along a single direction, and reconstructed
  points are restricted to fit inside the node (this could occur because
  of a lack of precision) by clipping the coordinates.

- `trisoup: unique points are selected at block level`:  
  Since points are restricted to be reconstructed locally to a node,
  the selection of the unique points can be (and is) performed at a block
  level rather than at a global point cloud level.

  Sort has ~N*log(N) complexity. Working locally reduces complexity and
  is better for memory access.

Some additionnal code simplifications and optimizations have been made,
as well as some changes in the motion search presets in order to improve
the execution speed:
- `trisoup: optimize determineTriSoupVertices function`,
- `trisoup: code reorganization for faster execution`,
- `trisoup/ctc: change motion search preset`.

Finally `ges-tm-v1.0-rc1` also includes additional code cleanups, minor bug
fixes and modifications to support the common test conditions which have been
agreed during the meeting.
